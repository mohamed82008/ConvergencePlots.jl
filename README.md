# ConvergencePlots

This is a Julia package that makes it easy to do live tracking of the convergence of your algorithm. All the plotting is done using [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl).

## Installation

To install `ConvergencePlots.jl`, run the following Julia code.

```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add https://github.com/mohamed82008/ConvergencePlots.jl"
```

## Usage

First create an empty plot:
```julia
plot = ConvergencePlot()
```
This will create an empty convergence plot that plots up to 100000 history points. Older points are overwritten. To specify how many history points to plot, use the constructor:
```julia
plot = ConvergencePlot(n)
```
where `n` is the number of points.

The keyword arguments you can pass to the `ConvergencePlot` constructor are:
- `names`: a `Vector{String}` that has all the names of the convergence metrics to be plotted. The default value of `names` is `["Residual"]`.
- `options`: a dictionary mapping each name in `names` to a `NamedTuple`. Each named tuple has the plotting options to pass to `PyPlot`, e.g. `(label = "KKT residual", ls = "--", marker = "+")`. If `label` is not passed, it defaults to the corresponding name in `names`. You can also pass a single `NamedTuple` of options without the `label` option, and it will be used for all the names.
- `show`: if `true` the empty figure will be displayed. This is `false` by default.

After creating an empty plot, you can add points to it as follows:
```julia
add_point!(plot, Dict("Residual" => 1.0))
```
where the second argument can contain one value for each name in `names`. If only a single name exists, you can also use:
```julia
add_point!(plot, 1.0)
```
Adding a point will display the plot by default. To stop the plot from displaying, set the `show` keyword argument to `false`.

To close the plot, call:
```julia
closeplot!(plot)
```

## Example

```julia
using ConvergencePlots

plot = ConvergencePlot(names = ["KKT residual", "|Î”x|"])
kkt_residual = 1 ./ (1:50)
delta_x = sqrt.(kkt_residual)
for i in 1:50
    sleep(1e-4)
    add_point!(plot, Dict("KKT residual" => kkt_residual[i], "|Î”x|" => delta_x[i]))
end
```
